   -----                          ------                 -----------
 + faster data b/w CPU                               - Slower data transfer between CPU

 - CPU ( cache coherence )                           + Programmer controls all data transfer 
   controls some data transfers

 - Less scalable in CPU/Memory                       + Scalable in CPU/Memoery

 - Price/performance ration is higher                + Price/performance ratio is lowers

                                                     + Job scheduling easier
