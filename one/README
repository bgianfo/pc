1a. (10pts) Find a set of 8 integers to be used as command line arguments for
            PrimeTesterSeq and PrimeTesterSmp that satisfy the following conditions:

           - Each integer must be different.

           - Each integer must be greater than or equal to 2^61 = 2305843009213693952.

           - Each integer must be less than or equal to 2^62 = 4611686018427387904.

           - The running time of PrimeTesterSmp with these integers on parasite using
             8 processors must exceed 45000msec.

           - The efficiency of PrimeTesterSmp with these integers on parasite using 8 processors
             must be greater than 0.95.

      Measure the running time T for PrimeTesterSeq with these integers on parasite and 
      PrimeTesterSmp with these integers on parasite using 1, 2, 4, and 8 processors.
      Calculate Speedup and Eff as a function of K (the number of processors).
      Submit your results in a table organized as follows:


                           ------------------------------------
                           | K   | T (msec) | Speedup |  Eff  |
                           ------------------------------------
                           | Seq |          |         |       |

                           |  4  |          |         |       |
                           ------------------------------------
                           |  8  |          |         |       |
                           ------------------------------------

      Explain why this set of integers leads to high efficiency.

1b. (10pts) Find a set of 8 integers to be used as command line arguments for
            PrimeTesterSeq and PrimeTesterSmp that satisfy the following conditions:

            - Each integer must be different.

            - Each integer must be greater than or equal to 2^61 = 2305843009213693952.

            - The running time of PrimeTesterSmp with these integers on parasite using
              8 processors must exceed 45000msec.

            - The efficiency of PrimeTesterSmp with these integers on parasite using 8
              processors must be less than 0.175.

      Measure the running time T for PrimeTesterSeq with these integers on parasite and
      PrimeTesterSmp with these integers on parasite using 1, 2, 4, and 8 processors.
      Calculate Speedup and Eff as a function of K (the number of processors).
